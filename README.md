## Learning Goals and Key Concepts based on the Task Instructions:

**Learning Goals:**

* Understand the concepts of containerization and Docker.
* Learn how to build Docker images using Dockerfiles.
* Gain experience with running and managing multiple Docker containers.
* Explore how Docker Compose simplifies multi-container application deployment.
* Implement a basic reverse proxy and load balancer using Nginx in a Docker container.
* Connect front-end and back-end applications running in separate Docker containers.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Docker:** A platform for containerizing applications.
* **Docker Container:** An isolated environment that includes everything an application needs to run.
* **Docker Image:** A blueprint for creating a Docker container.
* **Dockerfile:** A text file that defines the instructions for building a Docker image.
* **Docker Compose:** A tool for defining and running multi-container applications.
* **Reverse Proxy:** A server that forwards requests to other servers based on the URL.
* **Load Balancer:** A device or software that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers.
* **Round Robin Load Balancing:** A basic load balancing algorithm that distributes traffic evenly across servers.
* **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** A mechanism that allows web pages from different domains to request resources from each other.

This project guides you through building a multi-container application with a front-end, back-end, and a proxy server utilizing Docker and Docker Compose. You'll learn how to create Dockerfiles, connect services, and implement a simple load balancing strategy.
